## FibraMax

## Description
FibraMax is a Rust program that calculates the highest Fibonacci number possible within a time limit of 1 second using the conventional method of repeatedly adding the last two numbers to get the next number in the Fibonacci series.

## Requirements
Rust programming language installed on your system

## Usage
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Nightmare9801/FibraMax
- Navigate to the project directory: cd FibraMax
- Compile the Rust program: cargo build --release
- Run the program: cargo run --release

## Performance
The program is optimized using efficient algorithms to find the highest Fibonacci number within 1 second.

## Implementation
The program uses the conventional method of adding the last two numbers to generate the next number in the Fibonacci series.
It leverages Rust's performance capabilities to calculate Fibonacci numbers quickly.
